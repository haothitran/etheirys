Confirm steps to all stages by completing another Anima weapon. Confirm coordinates for all NPCs. Add links to dungeon and trial pages. General Information \u2693\ufe0e Due to its obsolete stats, I would recommend reaching maximum level to have an easier time grinding out this quest chain. You can work on multiple Heavensward relic weapons at the same time, so long you are on different stages for each weapon. Personal Experience In comparison to A Realm Reborn's Zodiac weapons, the Heavensward's Anima weapons heavily depend on acquiring items purchased with Grand Company Seals and Poetics. If you pre-purchase and stockpile all these required items, you can finish this quest line in a couple days. Stages \u2693\ufe0e Animated Awoken Anima Hyperconductive Reconditioned Sharp Complete Lux Prerequisites \u2693\ufe0e Completed Main Scenario Quest: Heavensward Reach level 60 for your chosen job of: Paladin, Warrior, Monk, Dragoon, Bard, Ninja, Black Mage, Summoner, White Mage, Scholar, Machinist, Astrologian, or Dark Knight.

Total Cost \u2693\ufe0e Some items will not be available to purchase at Merchant NPCs until you have reached certain stages. Optional items can be acquired by other methods.

Your next relic weapons will start from Soul without Life step. Speak with Ardashir (Azys Lla, X:7.4, Y:11.5 ). Soul without Life \u2693\ufe0e Speak to Ardashir (Azys Lla, X:7.4, Y:11.5 ) to pick up the quest: Soul without Life Speak with Rowena (Mor Dhona, X:21.9, Y:4.9 ). Speak with Syndony (Mor Dhona, X:22.6, Y:5.8 ) upstairs on the balcony. She will provide the required Astral Nodule (x1) and Umbral Nodule (x1) from one of the following methods: Trade in a Zodiac Zeta relic weapon to receive both Nodules. This is the final stage of an A Realm Reborn relic weapon. Trade in one Luminous Crystal of each type (x6) from successfully completing FATEs in specific zones. Report back to Ardashir. Congratulations! You have completed this stage. Option 1: Trade in Zodiac Zeta relic weapon This will destroy your A Realm Reborn relic weapon! If you decide to trade in your Zodiac Zeta weapon, ensure that you have finished The Vital Title quest from Jalzahn (North Shroud, X:29.5, Y:19.6 ). Completing this quest allows you purchase replicas of your A Ream Reborn relic weapon from Drake (North Shroud, X:30.3, Y:20.1 ). If you did not complete this quest before trading in your Zodiac Zeta weapon, you are out of luck and will only be able to get back the initial step of the relic ( Zenith ) from a Calamity Salvager NPC located in the main cities: Old Gridania ( X:10, Y:8.4 ) Limsa Lominsa Upper Decks ( X:11.3, Y:14.3 ) Ul'dah ( X:12.6, Y:13.1 ) Option 2: Collecting Luminous Crystals To receive any Luminous Crystals from FATEs, you must have in your quest Journal: Soul without Life Any FATE in the specified zone can drop Luminous Crystals, but it must be successfully completed. Luminous Crystals are not a guaranteed drop. You can get one from the first FATE you do in a zone, or it can be from the 20th FATE. You can complete FATEs as any job. Zone Luminous Crystal The Sea of Clouds Wind Azys Lla Fire The Churning Mists Lightning Coerthas Western Highlands Ice Dravanian Forelands Earth Dravanian Hinterlands Water Tip When you receive a Luminous Crystal, there will be an in-game popup notification. You can't miss it! Luminous Crystals will go into your inventory. Ensure that you have enough free inventory space! You only need one type of Luminous Crystal per relic weapon. This is a a good opportunity to train your Chocobo companion in combat. Personal Experience It took me less than one hour to collect all Luminous Crystals. 2.

You can use the Anima Glass to determine your progress in your Key Items inventory. Personal Experience You can farm for Amber-encased Vilekin by spamming one levequest up to your leve allowance. Leve allowances stack up to 100 maximum and recharges 3 allowances every 12 hours real time. Speak with Elion (The Foundation, X:10.1, Y:10.3 ) > Battlecraft Leves > Level 50 > Necrologos: Of Sallow Vizards Travel to Falcon's Nest to the levequest location. Initiate the levequest, but do not complete the objective! Your goal here is to find Treasure Coffers in the general vicinity of the levequest. If you find it, great! You are rewarded Amber-encased Vilekin (x1). If don't find it, then tough luck! Open your quest Journal > Abandon the levequest > Retry > Initiate Repeat until you have used up all your levequest allowance. It took me about one hour to gather 30 Amber-encased Vilekins using up 100 levequest allowances. Of course, this will depend on your luck with Treasure Coffer spawns. 6.

Some FATEs are triggered after certain events (e.g. after speaking with an NPC) For leves: There are two types of levequest NPCs \u2014 one for general leves and one for Grand Company leves. Ensure that you are speaking to the correct NPC. If you do not see your required levequest, then you can clear out other levequests to try to force the one you need to spawn. To start a levequest: Pick up the levequest. Go to the levequest location marked on your map. Open your quest Journal then initiate the quest. After completing the levequest, you are offered a teleport back to the levequest NPC. This is a a good opportunity to train your Chocobo companion in combat. Personal Experience This is a very time-consuming stage. Ready a music playlist, show series, or podcast. You are going to need it. I would recommend that you complete all tasks in one zone before moving onto the next zone to save yourself teleport fees. Generally, moving in this region order will be cheapest: Mor Dhona Coerthas Central Highlands The Black Shroud Thanalan La Noscea If a required FATE is not active when you teleport to the zone, I recommend you queue into the required dungeons for the book while waiting for the FATE to spawn. Check if the FATE is active between each dungeon. If you finish the required dungeons and the FATE hasn't spawned yet, then move onto the next zone or clear the currently active FATEs in the zone to try to force the one you need to spawn.

It will drop randomly. Purchased from your Grand Company's Hunt Billmaster for 50 Allied Seals each for a total of 3,750 Allied Seals. From treasure chests from Mysterious Maps.

You can only hold a maximum of three Mysterious Maps at a time. Deciper the map in your inventory by right-clicking the map > Decipher Find the location marked on your mysterious map. Use Action & Traits > General > Dig > Loot Treasure Coffer You will receive Alexandrite (x5) from each Mysterious Map. How to carry multiple Mysterious Maps? Buy a map and place it in your Chocobo's saddlebag. Buy a second map and decipher it. Buy a third map and leave it in your inventory. Doing this allows you to hold three maps at the same time which means that you will only need to return to Auriana five times to to get all the Alexandrite you need. Example of a Mysterious Map Sphere Scroll Once you have obtained 75 Alexandrite, you will need to infuse them into your Sphere Scroll by right-clicking the scroll > Infuse You will start with Materia I, then move on to II, III, and IV. Since this is an outdated weapon, what materia stats you infuse does not really matter. Either use materia that you have on hand, or purchase whatever is cheapest on the Market Board. There is a maximum cap for secondary stats for each relic weapon. You can infuse up to a maximum of five different secondary stats. As you start infusing materia, the infusion success rate will depreciate until you are forced to use a higher grade materia. If the infusion fails, the materia is lost, but the Alexandrite is not consumed. Example of a Partially Completed Sphere Scroll 6.

Syrcus Tower ? ? ? The World of Darkness ? ? ? Personal Experience I would recommend running The Aurum Vale unsycned repeatedly until you have earned all 2000 light points. It is less tedious than running Sastasha or Tam-Tara Deepcroft because you don't have to interact with anything to progress through the dungeon. You only have to kill 6 enemies. You can run through all enemies except 3 Goldvine morbols to open walls and the 3 bosses. At the end of the dungeon, open the Duty Finder > Leave to quickly exit the duty. If you try to exit through the portal at the end, you risk being interrupted by all the enemies you skipped that followed you. As a level 90 Bard, one Aurum Vale run took about 2 minutes and 10 seconds and gave Brilliant light (48 points). Thus, it will take 42 runs of Aurum Vale to acquire enough light points. Otherwise stated, about two hours of continuous farming. 7.

Select dialogue option: Zodiac Awakening Congratulations! You have completed your A Realm Reborn relic weapon. Mahatmas List of Mahatma: Using the Zodiac Glass to check soul resonance level of a Mahatma: Personal Experience Like in the Nexus stage, I would recommend running The Aurum Value unsynced.

Some FATEs are triggered after certain events (e.g. after speaking with an NPC) For leves: There are two types of levequest NPCs \u2014 one for general leves and one for Grand Company leves. Ensure that you are speaking to the correct NPC. If you do not see your required levequest, then you can clear out other levequests to try to force the one you need to spawn. To start a levequest: Pick up the levequest. Go to the levequest location marked on your map. Open your quest Journal then initiate the quest. After completing the levequest, you are offered a teleport back to the levequest NPC. This is a a good opportunity to train your Chocobo companion in combat.

Generally, moving in this region order will be cheapest: Mor Dhona Coerthas Central Highlands The Black Shroud Thanalan La Noscea If a required FATE is not active when you teleport to the zone, I recommend you queue into the required dungeons for the book while waiting for the FATE to spawn. Check if the FATE is active between each dungeon. If you finish the required dungeons and the FATE hasn't spawned yet, then move onto the next zone or clear the currently active FATEs in the zone to try to force the one you need to spawn.
