This is my personal reference guide for [Final Fantasy XIV](https://www.finalfantasyxiv.com/) content. You will mostly find information for dungeon, trial, and raid encounters.

All content is personally verified by my personal in-game experiences.

## Motivation

I created this wiki because I found that other FFXIV resources were poorly written. Either they were missing key information or it was a wall of rambling text with vague descriptions. I grew frustrated trying to use these resources and started this project for myself and some friends.

This project also provides me an opportunity to use [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) and the feature-rich [Material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) theme.
