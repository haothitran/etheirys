# Zodiac Weapons

!!! bug "Personal Note — To Do"
    - [ ] Add introduction paragraph.
    - [ ] Confirm steps to all stages by completing another Zodiac weapon.
    - [ ] Add associated quest names to all stages.
    - [ ] Confirm coordinates for all NPCs and enemies.
    - [ ] Confirm if it is possible to exchange a Trial of the Brave book before it is completed.
    - [ ] Add links to dungeon and trial pages.

## General Information

- At minimum, it will take several days to complete your A Realm Reborn relic weapon.
- I would recommend reaching maximum level to have an easier time grinding out this long and tedious quest chain.
- You can save gil by having all crafting jobs at level 50 or above. However, this is not necessary as you can purchase required crafted items from the Market Board.

!!! danger "Do not discard relic weapon"
    Do not discard your relic weapon! You will not be able to purchase any of the replicas without having the completed relic weapon in your inventory from [Drake](https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/playguide/db/shop/f2cb98f29d2/) (North Shroud, `X:30.3, Y:20.1`).

    If you accidently discarded your relic weapon, you will only be able to get back the initial step of the relic ([Zenith](#2-zenith)) from a Calamity Salvager NPC located in the main cities:

        - Atma will go into your inventory. Ensure that you have enough free inventory space!
        - You only need one type of Atma per relic weapon.
        - This is a a good opportunity to train your Chocobo companion in combat.

    !!! example "Personal Experience"
        It took me close to three hours to collect all Atma crystals.

1. Speak with Jalzahn with your relic weapon equipped.

    ??? example "Example of a Trial of the Braves book"
        ![](assets/zodiac-weapons_book-trials-of-the-braves.png)

4. Report back to Jalzahn.
    - Unequip your relic weapon.
    - Select dialogue option: `Relic Weapon Atma Enhancement`
5. Congratulations! You have completed this stage.
    - For whatever reason, the last book will remain in your `Key Items` inventory.
    - To remove the last book, return to G'jusana and select dialogue option: `Disposal`

!!! tip
    - You must have your Atma relic weapon equipped when purchasing a book and completing tasks.
    - You can only have one book at a time.
    - For dungeons:
        - You can complete dungeons unsynced in an Unrestricted Party.
    - For FATEs:
        - If you do not see your required FATE, then you can clear other FATEs in the zone to try to force the one you need to spawn. Or wait for currently active FATEs to time out.
        - Some FATEs are triggered after certain events (e.g. after speaking with an NPC)
    - For leves:
        - There are two types of levequest NPCs — one for general leves and one for Grand Company leves. Ensure that you are speaking to the correct NPC.
        - If you do not see your required levequest, then you can clear out other levequests to try to force the one you need to spawn.
        - To start a levequest:
            1. Pick up the levequest.
            2. Go to the levequest location marked on your map.
            3. Open your quest Journal then initiate the quest.
            4. After completing the levequest, you are offered a teleport back to the levequest NPC.
    - This is a a good opportunity to train your Chocobo companion in combat.

!!! example "Personal Experience"
    This is a very time-consuming stage. Ready a music playlist, show series, or podcast. You are going to need it.

    I would recommend that you complete all tasks in one zone before moving onto the next zone to save yourself teleport fees. Generally, moving in this region order will be cheapest:

    1. Mor Dhona
    2. Coerthas Central Highlands
    3. The Black Shroud
    4. Thanalan
    5. La Noscea

    If a required FATE is not active when you teleport to the zone, I recommend you queue into the required dungeons for the book while waiting for the FATE to spawn. Check if the FATE is active between each dungeon. If you finish the required dungeons and the FATE hasn't spawned yet, then move onto the next zone or clear the currently active FATEs in the zone to try to force the one you need to spawn.

??? info "Mysterious Maps: Method 2 — Purchase with 1,125 Allagan Tomestones of Poetics"
    1. Speak to Auriana > `Mysterious Map Exchange`
        - Purchase a Mysterious Map (x15) for 75 Poetics each for a total of 1,125 Poetics.
        - You can only hold a maximum of three Mysterious Maps at a time.

    3. Find the location marked on your mysterious map.
    4. Use `Action & Traits` > `General` > `Dig` > Loot Treasure Coffer
    5. You will receive Alexandrite (x5) from each Mysterious Map.

    !!! question "How to carry multiple Mysterious Maps?"
        1. Buy a map and place it in your Chocobo's saddlebag.
        2. Buy a second map and `decipher` it.
        3. Buy a third map and leave it in your inventory.

        Doing this allows you to hold three maps at the same time which means that you will only need to return to Auriana five times to to get all the Alexandrite you need.

    ??? example "Example of a Mysterious Map"
        ![](assets/zodiac-weapons_alexandrite-map.png)

!!! info "Sphere Scroll"
    - Once you have obtained 75 Alexandrite, you will need to infuse them into your Sphere Scroll by right-clicking the scroll > `Infuse`
    - You will start with Materia I, then move on to II, III, and IV.
        - Since this is an outdated weapon, what materia stats you infuse does not really matter. Either use materia that you have on hand, or purchase whatever is cheapest on the Market Board.
        - There is a maximum cap for secondary stats for each relic weapon.
        - You can infuse up to a maximum of five different secondary stats.
    - As you start infusing materia, the infusion success rate will depreciate until you are forced to use a higher grade materia.
        - If the infusion fails, the materia is lost, but the Alexandrite is not consumed.

        | Robust      |  1200-1399  |
        | Vigorous    |  1400-1599  |
        | Intense     |  1600-1799  |

        ![](assets/zodiac-weapons_light-partial.png)
        ![](assets/zodiac-weapons_light-complete.png)


    - Complete various activities to earn light points:

        | Light Earned | Light Value |
        | :----------- | :---------: |
        | Feeble       |      8      |
        | Gentle       |     16      |

        | Blinding     |     96      |
        | Newborn Star |     128     |

    - Some activities will randomly yield bonus light points for a certain time.

        | Activities                    | Light Earned | Base Value | Bonus Value |

        | The World of Darkness         | ?            |     ?      |      ?      |

!!! example "Personal Experience"
    I would recommend running The Aurum Vale unsycned repeatedly until you have earned all 2000 light points. It is less tedious than running Sastasha or Tam-Tara Deepcroft because you don't have to interact with anything to progress through the dungeon. You only have to kill 6 enemies. You can run through all enemies except 3 Goldvine morbols to open walls and the 3 bosses. At the end of the dungeon, open the `Duty Finder` > `Leave` to quickly exit the duty. If you try to exit through the portal at the end, you risk being interrupted by all the enemies you skipped that followed you.

    As a level 90 Bard, one Aurum Vale run took about 2 minutes and 10 seconds and gave Brilliant light (48 points). Thus, it will take 42 runs of Aurum Vale to acquire enough light points. Otherwise stated, about two hours of continuous farming.

!!! example "Personal Experience"
    Like in the Nexus stage, I would recommend running The Aurum Value unsynced. You will only need to complete the dungeon twice to fully complete one Mahatma. So 12 Mahatma x 2 runs of Aurum Vale each = 24 Aurum Vale runs to complete this stage.
