# Anima Weapons

!!! bug "Personal Note — To Do"
    - [ ] Add introduction paragraph.
    - [ ] Confirm steps to all stages by completing another Anima weapon.
    - [ ] Confirm coordinates for all NPCs.
    - [ ] Add links to dungeon and trial pages.

## General Information

- Due to its obsolete stats, I would recommend reaching maximum level to have an easier time grinding out this quest chain.
- You can work on multiple Heavensward relic weapons at the same time, so long you are on different stages for each weapon.

!!! example "Personal Experience"
    In comparison to A Realm Reborn's Zodiac weapons, the Heavensward's Anima weapons heavily depend on acquiring items purchased with Grand Company Seals and Poetics. If you pre-purchase and stockpile all these required items, you can finish this quest line in a couple days.

!!! danger "Option 1: Trade in Zodiac Zeta relic weapon"
    This will destroy your A Realm Reborn relic weapon! 
    
    If you decide to trade in your Zodiac Zeta weapon, ensure that you have finished [The Vital Title](https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/playguide/db/quest/edcdb18b80f/) quest from Jalzahn (North Shroud, `X:29.5, Y:19.6`). Completing this quest allows you purchase replicas of your A Ream Reborn relic weapon from Drake (North Shroud, `X:30.3, Y:20.1`). 
    
    If you did not complete this quest before trading in your Zodiac Zeta weapon, you are out of luck and will only be able to get back the initial step of the relic ([Zenith](/relics/zodiac-weapons/#2-zenith)) from a Calamity Salvager NPC located in the main cities:

    - To receive any Luminous Crystals from FATEs, you must have in your quest Journal: [Soul without Life](https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/playguide/db/quest/0136a6df60a/)
    - Any FATE in the specified zone can drop Luminous Crystals, but it must be successfully completed.
    - Luminous Crystals are not a guaranteed drop. You can get one from the first FATE you do in a zone, or it can be from the 20th FATE.
    - You can complete FATEs as any job.

However, this is the least efficient method because it requires you to run each of the three Crystal Tower alliance raids (Labyrinth of the Ancients, Syrcus Tower, and The World of Darkness) per Aether Oil. So 1 Aether Oil x 3 alliance raids = 15 total alliance raid runs.
    2. Purchase with 1,750 Poetics.

        ![](assets/anima-weapons_treat-crystal-sand.png)

    !!! example "Personal Experience"
        - You can farm for Amber-encased Vilekin by spamming one levequest up to your leve allowance. 
        - Leve allowances stack up to 100 maximum and recharges 3 allowances every 12 hours real time.

        1. Speak with Elion (The Foundation, `X:10.1, Y:10.3`) > `Battlecraft Leves` > `Level 50` > `Necrologos: Of Sallow Vizards`
        2. Travel to Falcon's Nest to the levequest location.
        3. Initiate the levequest, but do not complete the objective!
        4. Your goal here is to find Treasure Coffers in the general vicinity of the levequest.
            - If you find it, great! You are rewarded Amber-encased Vilekin (x1).
            - If don't find it, then tough luck!
        5. Open your quest Journal > `Abandon` the levequest > `Retry` > `Initiate`
        6. Repeat until you have used up all your levequest allowance.

        ![](assets/anima-weapons_crystal-sands_amber-encased-vilekin.png)

        It took me about one hour to gather 30 Amber-encased Vilekins using up 100 levequest allowances. Of course, this will depend on your luck with Treasure Coffer spawns.
