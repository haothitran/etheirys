# Sastasha

> After a period of relative silence following the Calamity, the Serpent Reavers have once again taken to terrorizing the inland hamlets of La Noscea—killing the men, kidnapping the women and children, plundering the storehouses, and burning what little they leave behind. For years, it was not known how the pirates were able to raid areas so far from the coast, until a local shepherd sighted a band of painted ruffians entering the Sastasha Seagrot, carrying large quantities of sacks and crates. Could it be that there is more to this cave than meets the eye?

???+ tip "Bloody Memo"
    At the beginning of the dungeon, there is an alcove to the south where you will find a Bloody Memo. Reading this note will reveal which upcoming Coral Formation will spawn the first boss.

## Chopper

- Boss will flee a number of times:

    2. Open the Captain's Quarters and kill the Shallowtail Reaver to obtain Waverider Gate key
    3. Open Waverider Gate to progress through rest of dungeon

## Denn the Orcatoothed

- It is possible to nuke the boss before adds spawn
    - **Unnatural Ripples** — Standing on a grate prevents adds from spawning when `bubbles begin forming on the water's surface`. There are a total of four grates near the corners of the arena.
- **Dodgeball** — Avoid frontal cone AoE
